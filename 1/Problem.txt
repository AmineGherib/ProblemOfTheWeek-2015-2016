2015 Week 1 - Looking for Love (Solved by: 12 Students (35.29% of total))

Will has been feeling pretty lonely lately. In order to help himself he creates a dating website. Being a computer scientist, he comes up with an interesting way of computing how well one person would match with another. 

Based on the information entered, Will creates a 32 bit unsigned integer which acts as a mask for the person's data. In order to compute compatibility between a couple Will checks how many similar bits they have. The more similarity the better the match. One also has to keep in mind though, opposites attract. 

Your goal is to design an algorithm that displays the couple with the highest compatibility level, and the lowest compatibility level. 

Input: 
An integer N denoting the number of people registered on Will's dating site 
N string integer pairs of the form: 
name int 
Meaning that name's value is int 

Output: 
Two pairs of strings separated by a new line, the first being the names of the couple with the highest similarity level, and the second being the names of the couple with the lowest similarity level
