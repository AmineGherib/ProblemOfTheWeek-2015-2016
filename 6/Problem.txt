2015 Week 6 - Margare_t (Solved by: 7 Students (20.59% of total))

Margaret has picked up quite a few things over the years of listening to the Computer Science nerds communicate. One thing she has been interested in recently are scheduling algorithms.

Margaret has a bunch of events to plan for, and these events have a logical ordering. For example, the meeting to vote on the new 140 professor must be scheduled before the meeting announcing who will be filling the position (fingers crossed). She has a list of events, each having a (possibly empty) set of prerequisites, but is having problem making sense of it and coming up with an ordering. 

Input: 
- An integer n 
- n lines of the format event1 event2 (you can assume event names do not contain spaces), denoting that event1 must occur before event2

Output: 
A space separated list of event names which represents a suggested ordering. The events in the sequence must be ordered such that for any event e in the sequence all of e's prerequisite events appear before it in the sequence. 

If more than one possible ordering exists simply output one. 

You may assume that all events are connected in some way, and no circular dependencies exist.
